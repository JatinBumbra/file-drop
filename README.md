## About
A dummy UI for a file-upload service created for fun and practice. To test -

- Visit the above link. Initially there will be no files
- Click ***Upload Files*** button, select some files and click ***Start Upload***. 
- There will be some cool progress bar, and once upload is complete, your files will appear in the UI.

***NOTE:*** The files are not uploaded to any server. It's just a UI project for showcasing frontend skills.
